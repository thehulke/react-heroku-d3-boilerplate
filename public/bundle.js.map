The throttled function comes with a `cancel`\n\t     * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to\n\t     * immediately invoke them. Provide an options object to indicate whether\n\t     * `func` should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`\n\t     * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the\n\t     * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n\t     * result of the last `func` invocation.\n\t     *\n\t     * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n\t     * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n\t     * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t     *\n\t     * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n\t     * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n\t     *\n\t     * @static\n\t     * @memberOf _\n\t     * @since 0.1.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n\t     * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n\t     * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n\t     * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true]\n\t     *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n\t     * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n\t     *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n\t     * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     * // Avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling.\n\t     * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n\t     *\n\t     * // Invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes.\n\t     * var throttled = _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, { 'trailing': false });\n\t     * jQuery(element).on('click', throttled);\n\t     *\n\t     * // Cancel the trailing throttled invocation.\n\t     * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n\t     */\n\t    function throttle(func, wait, options) {\n\t      var leading = true,\n\t          trailing = true;\n\t\n\t      if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t        throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t      }\n\t      if (isObject(options)) {\n\t        leading = 'leading' in options ? !!options.leading : leading;\n\t        trailing = 'trailing' in options ? !!options.trailing : trailing;\n\t      }\n\t      return debounce(func, wait, {\n\t        'leading': leading,\n\t        'maxWait': wait,\n\t        'trailing': trailing\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Creates a function that accepts up to one argument, ignoring any\n\t     * additional arguments.\n\t     *\n\t     * @static\n\t     * @memberOf _\n\t     * @since 4.0.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @param {Function} func The function to cap arguments for.\n\t     * @returns {Function} Returns the new capped function.\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     * _.map(['6', '8', '10'], _.unary(parseInt));\n\t     * // => [6, 8, 10]\n\t     */\n\t    function unary(func) {\n\t      return ary(func, 1);\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Creates a function that provides `value` to the wrapper function as its\n\t     * first argument.
